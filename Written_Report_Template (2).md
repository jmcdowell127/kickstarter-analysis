# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Analyzing how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals for Louise.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
This chart below displays when theatres were either successful, failed, or canceled on a monthly basis between 2009 and 2017.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The chart below displays the direct relationship between the set goal for a campaign and the outcomes based on that monetary goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The main difficulty with these chart was the COUNTIFS formulas. Through trial and error of filtering columns versus writing a longer COUNTIFS formula took some time but was eventually accomplished.
## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. The most successful time of year for theatre outcomes is during the summer season(May through August), especially in the months of May and June.
2. The least successul time of year for theatre outcomes is during the winter season, especially from the months of November through January.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
1. The highest percentage of successful campaigns were between the ranges of $0 to $15,000.00 as well as $35,000.00 to $44,999.00.
2. The most successful campaigns had a goal below $5,000.00, while the least successful campaigns had a goal of $45,000.00 or higher.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. This dataset is not a very large sample size once filtered down to Louise's interests and needs. 
2. The only locations given were by country, which is vague and does not help with finding which cities and venues to launch at.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
-- A histogram would be helpful in filtering out outliers that are not relatable.
